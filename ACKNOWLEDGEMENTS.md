A significant portion of the protocol knowledge in Alkahest is based on research
done by the developers of the
[tera-data](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-data) and
[Shinra Meter](https://github.com/neowutran/ShinraMeter) projects.

The encryption code is based on the defunct
[TERA emulator project](https://github.com/iceblade112/TeraEmulator); a license
was not specified for that code. It has been simplified based on
[Mirrawrs's Tera framework](https://github.com/Mirrawrs/Tera).

The data center parsing code is based on the file format knowledge in the
[TeraDataTools project](https://github.com/gothos-folly/TeraDataTools).

The client scanning functionality uses search patterns from the
[TeraScanners project](https://github.com/meishuu/TeraScanners),
[Mirrawrs's Tera framework](https://github.com/Mirrawrs/Tera), and
[Gl0's DLL](https://github.com/neowutran/TeraDpsMeterData/blob/master/copypaste-tuto/Gl0-dll.txt).
